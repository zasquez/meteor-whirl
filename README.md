# meteor-whirl
Pure CSS loading animations with minimal effort for meteor

## Installation

```
$ meteor add yasaricli:whirl
```


#### Basic usage

That's it!

```html
  <div class="whirl duo">
    This content is taking ages to load.
  </div>
```

####Options
From using the demo you can work out which classes you need to add to your elements in order to show the loading animation you want.

By default, you will always need `whirl`.

Then there are;

* `traditional`
* `duo`
* `double-up`
* `sphere`
* `sphere-vertical`
* `bar`
* `bar-follow`
* `line`
* `line grow`
* `line back-and-forth`
* `shadow`
* `shadow oval`/`shadow oval left`
* `shadow oval right`
* `ringed`
* `blade`
* `helicopter`

There is also `no-overlay` which will hide the overlay which is added by default.
